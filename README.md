# volcanic_eruption_prediction

- The idea involves prediction of volcanic eruption in a region using previous data on birth and death of dead volcanoes. The eruption of volcano depends upon the life of volcano and the conditions that exist in the region. 

- The idea works on the principle of predictability using machine learning algorithms. The datasets will be formed to use them for predictions.

- Users will be able to access the technology via an android app that will show predictions based on closest locations of volcanoes.

- Dataset will be built along the process using government data.

- Technologies used will be machine learning, android SDK, regression models.
